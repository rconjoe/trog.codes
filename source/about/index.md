## My 90's Intro to Tech: GameSharks, Phreaking, and 2600 Magazine

My first stroke of luck was growing up in the 90's, a time where interactions with a home computer were the most likely to expose the user to a DOS command line, given that a GUI with point-and-click "windows" didn't land in most homes before 1995.

<br />
This kind of lower-level exposure to technology planted seeds of curiosity in my mind that I would come back to many years later to find a home there. My father and older brother had a PC that ran DOOM and a few other games that required remembering some commands to launch.

I don't remember how, but somewhere very early along the way, I found <a href="https://www.2600.com">2600 Magazine</a>, and asked my father if I could get a quarterly subscription to it. I can only assume that he happily obliged having no idea what 2600 actually was, perhaps considering his son's interest in technology worth supporting. So there I was, 10 years old, rushing home from school hoping that the latest issue of the hacking mag was waiting for me in the mailbox. As far as I could tell, no correlation was made between my repeated disassembling of the telephone box to the reading of that magazine. ;)

A natural progression some years later was to be enamoured with the world of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameShark">GameShark</a>, a line of adapter cartridges awkwardly jammed between your system and game cartridge which offered a tremendously low barrier to entering into the world of computer memory and ways to manipulate it.

## Turning a Hobby Into a Career

By the 2010's, video games in many regions had already been established as a first-class citizen in new media. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft">Starcraft</a> became known as <a href="https://archive.esportsobserver.com/starcraft-ii-esports-essentials/">Korea's national pastime</a>. The explosion of <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2023/04/esports-around-the-world-usa">esports in North America</a> happened in front of us, around this time I would get my first glance at this world by organizing local fighting-game tournaments in Michigan.

During this time I began to recognize a pattern of unique, unfulfilled technical requirements appearing at each of the events I would work on. LAN parties and gaming tournaments may not have been anything new, however it was not yet a common thing to be moving 200 PC's or gaming consoles into a student center somewhere to host a massive event. There was exploding demand for these competitions in more and more places, but not the proportional amount of people who had experience putting them on. Everything from logistical hurdles to technical and broadcasting challenges seemed to require some novel solution. This was where I began to find a home, combining many of the things I'd learned (and equipment I was collecting) over time in order to solve these problems. This would become a theme over the next several years as I moved on to building bigger and bigger events, eventually traveling across the country from LA to Philadelphia to build systems at events like <a href="https://www.fragadelphia.com/">Fragadelphia </a> and turn a blank warehouse purchased by <a href="https://www.nerdstreet.com">Nerd Street Gamers</a> into a full-fledged LAN event center (now <a href="https://nerdstreet.com/events/localhost-grand-opening-at-nerd-street-s-the-block-2021-11-13?section=overview">The Block</a>), complete with stages and broadcast capabilities, then directing technical operations for the venue's <a href="https://nerdstreet.com/news/2021/11/incontrol-nation-open-up-the-block-loclhost-win-at-fragadelphia">inaugural event</a> in 2021.
