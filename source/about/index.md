I am a software and systems engineer with a unique set of experience and a strong track record of solving business problems with code. I am able to distill intricate technical concepts into a shared language that communicates the bottom line, lending to my skills as a reliable leader of software project teams.
My experience is atypical in that I have worked across a wide spectrum of disciplines in software engineering. Projects I have successfully delivered vary from Web API’s and ecommerce/retail process automation to deployment and administration of worldwide multiplayer game server networks.
I have spent several years teaching code in many environments - from developer bootcamps and in-house company workshops, to non-profit education for formerly incarcerated individuals. I find that at work, the insight I’ve been able to develop through this long standing love of pedagogy regularly proves advantageous. I, too, am a self-taught programmer, and so I believe strongly in free dissemination of the practice. Developers constantly learning around one another is fertilizer for a successful, cohesive, long-lasting team.
