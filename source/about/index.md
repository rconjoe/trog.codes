### Multidisciplinary software developer, systems engineer, and programming instructor.

<img src="/about/images/stageadmin.png" height="500" width="500">

A software engineer residing in Southern California, I've spent the last decade of my life writing code and building systems to run and scale it. My portfolio spans across web API's, automation, scripting, database engineering, and full-stack web development. I've also spent many years as a programming instructor in environments ranging from in-classroom bootcamp settings to fully online, one-to-one mentoring. My current interest is becoming proficient in lower-level languages and embedded systems. This is a blog where I write out my thoughts as I learn, or document projects as I build.
