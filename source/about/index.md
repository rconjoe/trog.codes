My name is Joe. I've spent the last decade solving business problems with code. Here is a synopsis of my journey:

## My 90's Intro to Tech: GameSharks, Phreaking, and 2600 Magazine:

My first stroke of luck was growing up in the 90's, a time where interactions with a home computer were the most likely to expose the user to a DOS command line, given that a GUI with point-and-click "windows" didn't land in most homes before 1995.

This kind of lower-level exposure to technology planted seeds of curiosity in my mind that I would come back to many years later to find a home there. My father and older brother had a PC that ran DOOM and a few other games that required remembering some commands to launch.

I don't remember how, but somewhere very early along the way, I found <a href="https://www.2600.com">2600 Magazine</a>, and asked my father if I could get a monthly subscription to it. I can only assume that he happily obliged having no idea what 2600 actually was, perhaps considering his son's interest in technology worth supporting. So there I was, 10 years old, rushing home from school hoping that the latest issue of the hacking mag was waiting for me in the mailbox. As far as I could tell, no correlation was made between my repeated disassembling of the telephone box to the reading of that magazine. ;)

A natural progression some years later was to be enamoured with the world of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameShark">GameShark</a>, a line of adapter cartridges awkwardly jammed between your system and game cartridge which offered a tremendously low barrier to entering into the world of computer memory and its manipulation.
